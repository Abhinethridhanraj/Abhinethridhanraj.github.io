			Wipro (formerly, Western India Palm Refined Oil Limited) is an Indian multinational corporation that provides information 
			technology, consulting and business process services. It is headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.
			The company was incorporated on 29 December 1945 in Amalner, Maharashtra by Mohamed Premji as "Western India Palm Refined Oil
			Limited", later abbreviated to "Wipro". It was initially set up as a manufacturer of vegetable and refined oils in Amalner, 
			Maharashtra, British India, under the trade names of Kisan, Sunflower, and Camel.

			In 1966, after Mohamed Premji's death, his son Azim Premji took over Wipro as its chairman at the age of 21.

			During the 1970s and 1980s, the company shifted its focus to new opportunities in the IT and computing industry,
			which was at a nascent stage in India at the time. On 7 June 1977, the name of the company changed from Western 
			India Vegetable Products Limited, to Wipro Products Limited. In 1982, the name was changed again, from Wipro Products 
			Limited to Wipro Limited.[10] Wipro continued to expand in the consumer products domain with the launch of "Ralak" a Tulsi 
			based family soap and "Wipro Jasmine", a toilet soap
