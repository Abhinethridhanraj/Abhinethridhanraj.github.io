			Justdial (sometimes stylised as JustDial or JD) is a company that provides local search for different services in 
			India over the phone and online. Founded in 1996 by VSS Mani,[1][6][7] the company is headquartered in Mumbai, India.
			In addition to its headquarters, Justdial has offices in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, New Delhi,
			Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, and Pune.[8] In 2019 Justdial had 12,691 employees[citation needed] and a database of 
			approximately 25.7 million listings and 500,838 active paid campaigns.
			In 1987, while working for a yellow pages company,[6] VSS Mani thought of replacing yellow pages with a database of 
			information that users could call to receive current information about local business listings.To launch his venture,
			Mani acquired[when?][citation needed] the Mumbai landline phone number 2888-8888. After several years of seeking financial 
			backing for his idea, Mani launched Justdial in 1996 with a seed capital of Rs. 50,000, five employees, a few rented computers,
			and borrowed furniture.[6][10][third-party source needed]

			In 2007 an Internet and mobile app version of the database called Justdial.com was launched.
			Justdial's "Justdial" service is a database of business listings that users can either access by phone or online. 
			The company also operates "Justdial Social", a service that aggregates content from social media websites, TV broadcast, 
			news, and other sources; and "Search Plus Service", a service that manages online transactions via the web and mobile apps.
