		<p1>
			PayPal Holdings, Inc. is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system that supports online 
			money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders.
			The company operates as a payment processor for online vendors, auction sites, and many other commercial users, for 
			which it charges a fee in exchange for benefits such as one-click transactions and password memory.
		
			Established in 1998 as Confinity, PayPal had its initial public offering in 2002, and became a wholly owned
			subsidiary of eBay later that year. eBay spun off PayPal in 2015. The company ranked 204th on the
			2019 Fortune 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue.
		
			At a 2019 World Economic Forum panel in Davos, founder Luke Nosek stated that PayPalâ€™s initial mission was to
			"create a global currency that was independent of interference by these, you know, corrupt cartels of banks and
			governments that were debasing their currencies". Nosek said this mission ultimately failed because of investor pressure 
			to release a product as soon as possible
