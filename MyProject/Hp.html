			The Hewlett-Packard Company (commonly referred to as HP, and stylized as hp), or Hewlett-Packard 
			(/ˈhjuːlɪt ˈpækərd/ HEW-lit PAK-ərd), was an American multinational information technology company 
			headquartered in Palo Alto, California. It developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components
			as well as software and related services to consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large 
			enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. In 1999, HP split into two
			companies: one retaining the original company name, the other named Agilent Technologies. The first product 
			line of Hewlett-Packard, test and measurement equipment, went to Agilent Technologies, while HP retained focus 
			on its later products including computers and printers. In 2015, HP again was split into two separate companies,
			HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

			The company was founded in a one-car garage (the historic HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue, an official California
			Historical Landmark; its plaque reads "Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'") in Palo Alto, California by Bill Hewlett
			and David Packard, and initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The company got its
			first big contract in 1938, providing its test and measurement instruments for production of Walt Disney Pictures'
			hugely successful animated film Fantasia. This success led Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to formally establish their
			Hewlett-Packard Company on 1 January 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its 
			products, and its management style and culture known as the HP Way which was adopted by other businesses worldwide. 
			HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 to Q2 2013, at which time Lenovo ranked ahead of HP.
			HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software
			and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers,
			related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. 
			HP directly marketed its products to households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises as well as via 
			online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors.
			HP also had services and a consulting business for its products and partner products.
